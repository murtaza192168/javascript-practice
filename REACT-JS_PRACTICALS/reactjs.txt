              // What is React
- React is a library and a JS framework for building user Interfaces
-React runs on a client / browser as a SPA(single page app), but can do full stack applications by communicating with server / applications eg. MERN stack


            // Why use REACT ?
            1) Structure view layer of an application
- Since MVC-Model View Conroller is a dessign pattern for software. 
    M: model deals with th data
    V: view is the part of the application that the user sees. And React is the V in MVC
    C: Controller deals witht the requests & routing\
            2) Reusable component and their own state
- React allows you to build the UI using REUSABLE COMPONENTS
  , so every part of the user interface has a DYNAMIC COMPONENT that can hold its own state and data
            
            3) JSX - Dynamic Markup 
- Here you dont have to SEPARATE your markup from the Logic (like javascript) bcz react uses JSX: JavaScript Syntax Exetension.
   and this allows us to write Dynamic HTML. Its JS.. but it is formatted as HTML
            4) Interactive UIs with virtual DOM
- Now the app that you build with React, are very Interactive bcz it uses VIRTUAL DOM.
 Virtual DOM: what this does is it allows you to update the parts of the page that needs to be updated, without a need to reload it
